In exercise, you will implement some basic DFT calculations.

submit_aims.sh       the script of submit aims task on Mahti    # sbatch submit_aims.sh

1. bulk
optimize lattice constant (example Au). Here, you can relax the whole cell (all three lattice vectors a, b, c and 3 angles) to obtain accurate values. More strictly, You can fit the potential energy surfaces by varing a, b, c. (More details in https://indico.ictp.it/event/a12198/session/20/contribution/12/material/0/1.pdf)

2. Surface energy (try to use the lattice constant calculated in task_bulk_au (compare your results with exps and references), and construct Au(111), Au(100) and Au(110) surfaces, optimize strucutres  and evaluate their surface energies)

from ase.build import fcc111, fcc100, fcc110
from ase.io import write
slab = fcc111('Au', size=(5,5,4), vacuum=15.0, a=4.08)
write("au111.in", slab, format='aims')
slab = fcc100('Au', size=(5,5,4), vacuum=15.0, a=4.08)
write("au100.in", slab, format='aims')
slab = fcc110('Au', size=(5,5,4), vacuum=15.0, a=4.08)
write("au110.in", slab, format='aims')
